Scenario: Matching Socks
The merchant has a big pile of socks from which she/he wants to pair up socks such that she/he keeps the pile as organized pairs of similar socks. 
Pairing up the socks will be based on the color (two socks of the same color will be paired up).

Interpretation

There is a total number of socks found in the pile and an array representing the colors of each sock. 
The matchingSocks function will return the number of pairs of socks. The socks with no matching colors will be discarded.

For example;

number of socks: 10
Array of colors[10] = {1,2,1,3,4,2,5,4,1,3}
Pairs returned: 4


-The programming language used is Python.
